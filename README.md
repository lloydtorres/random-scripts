==============

Scripts I've written to deal with various problems. Mostly written in Python.

#### JSON_Formatter.py

Takes in a `.json` file containing a one-liner JSON file and creates a new file that's nicely formatted.

Run from command line/terminal using:

`$PATH/JSON_Formatter.py  <path of JSON file>`

#### Myo_Imgur.lua

Adds Myo controls to Imgur.com through a Lua script.

* **Pinky to Thumb** - Activate controls.
* **Left Wave** - Previous image.
* **Right Wave** - Next image.
* **Spread Fingers** - Zoom image (if available).
* **Fist + Roll** - Scroll up/down.
