==============

Scripts I've written to deal with various problems. These scripts are licensed under the MIT License unless otherwise noted.

#### JSON_Formatter.py

Takes in a `.json` file containing a one-liner JSON file and creates a new file that's nicely formatted.

Run from command line/terminal using:

`python JSON_Formatter.py <path of JSON file>`

#### MouseControls.myo

A lot of devs at Hack the North had asked for a sample Lua mouse script for the Myo armband, so I uploaded a simple script that enabled mouse control.

* **Pinky to Thumb** - Activate/deactivate controls.
* **Left Wave** - Left-click.
* **Right Wave** - Right-click.
* **Fist Hold/Release** - Click and drag.

#### Imgur.myo

Adds Myo controls to Imgur.com through a Myo Connector.

* **Left Wave** - Previous image.
* **Right Wave** - Next image.
* **Spread Fingers** - Zoom image (if available).
* **Fist + Roll** - Scroll up/down.
